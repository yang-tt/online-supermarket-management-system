# online-supermarket-management-system
This project designed a relatively complete supermarket management system and implemented by C language. The system is divided into three sections: registered supermarket customers, registered supermarket administrators and unregistered users. Users can use the panel function after selecting the user category (customers and administrators are authenticated by login). The customer section has the functions of querying the supermarket product interface, querying the shopping cart, viewing order information and personal information management. The supermarket administrator section has the functions of Commodity Management, Personal Information Management and Order Management. 

This project uses the DEV C++ platform to implement the above functions in C language, and can run the program to generate txt files for reading and writing.
